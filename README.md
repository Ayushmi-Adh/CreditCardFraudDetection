## Project Overview:

The project involved analyzing a dataset of credit card transactions to detect fraudulent activities. Key steps included data exploration, data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and creating visualizations using Power BI to showcase the insights gained.

## Tools and Technologies:

- Python:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
- Power BI

## Data Exploration:

The data exploration phase involved:
- Loading the dataset from a CSV file
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing class distribution, transaction amounts, time vs. amount trends, and correlation heatmap

## Data Preprocessing:

Data preprocessing steps included:
- Standardization of transaction amounts
- Feature engineering (dropping unnecessary columns, handling missing values)

## Model Training and Evaluation:

Machine learning models trained and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
Evaluation metrics used: accuracy, recall, F1 score, precision

## Power BI Project:

A Power BI project was created to visualize the analysis results:
- Class distribution
- Transaction amount distribution
- Time vs. amount trends
- Correlation heatmap
- Model comparison metrics



## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ayushmi-Adh/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   ```


3. Explore the Jupyter Notebook in the `notebooks/` directory for detailed analysis steps.

4. Run the Power BI project file (`creditcard.pbix`) to interact with the visualizations.
